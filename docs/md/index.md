# p5.quadrille.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) [quadrille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_tiling) library.

In geometry, the square-tiling, square-tessellation or square-grid is a regular tiling of the Euclidean plane. [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) called it a quadrille.

The internal angle of the square is 90 degrees so four squares at a point make a full 360 degrees. It is one of three regular tilings of the plane. The other two are the triangular-tiling and the hexagonal-tiling.

This library may be useful to implement all sorts of [tile matching video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-matching_video_game). The library comprises a single `Quadrille` class and its reference is found along this site.

# Installation
